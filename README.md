**[SciDownl](https://github.com/Tishacy/SciDownl)** is created by **[Tishacy](https://github.com/Tishacy)**. I modified it to make it identify the captcha automatically. Then, users can  download papers in bulk.



## Implement

The identification function is implemented by using a commercial system named *[chaojiying](https://www.chaojiying.com/price.html)*. The price is 0.02 RMB for each identification. No charge if the identification result is wrong.



## Install

Users should install some python packages through the following cmd command.

`pip install -r requirements.txt `
